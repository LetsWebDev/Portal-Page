    <h1>Client Report</h1>
    <h2>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</h2>
    <p>I decided to go with an icecream website because it was simple enough to keep me from get carried away while designing it. I chose to make it about recipes so that there would be enough content to fill a webpage.</p>
    <h2>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?</h2>
    <p>I gave instrutions to my Agent(Lead Dev) primarly through the site plan. I sent aditional information through outlook when he needed it.</p>
    <h2>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</h2>
    <p>Yes the quality was what I had expected going into the project. But I was disapointed after I saw the final product because I had already seen the quailty of the projects I was under.</p>
    <h2>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</h2>
    <p>Try to get regular updates so I can see the direction the project is going and sugest changes before we run out of time.</p>
