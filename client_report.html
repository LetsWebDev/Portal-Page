        <h1>Client Report</h1>
        <h2>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</h2>
        <p>I decided to go with an icecream website because it was simple enough to keep me from get carried away while designing it. I chose to make it about recipes so that there would be enough content to fill a webpage.</p>
        <h2>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?</h2>
        <p>I gave instrutions to my Agent(Lead Dev) primarly through the site plan. I sent aditional information through outlook when he needed it.</p>
        <h2>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</h2>
        <p>Yes the quality was what I had expected going into the project. But I was disapointed after I saw the final product because I had already seen the quailty of the projects I was under.</p>
        <h2>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</h2>
        <p>Try to get regular updates so I can see the direction the project is going and sugest changes before we run out of time.</p>

        <h2>How did you manage your development team and comunicate the tasks for your junior devs?</h2>
        <p>I use outlook to email them their respoisibilities. I didn't send it to them however until Dec 9th. And I didn't concider the fact that on junior dev completeing the css for thier page would also complete the work for the other pages. (that is why style sheets exist though)</p>
        <h2>How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?</h2>
        <p>He emailed me his site plan and I was able to convert it into usable html and a basic style sheat with his defined colors and fonts for my devs to use. I did talk with him once in class to clearify how he got the fonts and how his content was supposed to fit into his wire frame.</p>
        <h2>How did you handle publishing your clients site and sharing it with the client?</h2>
        <p>GitHub is a brand new website/program for me, so I didn't have a clue how to do anything on it for the first week or two. After I got help setting it up I was able to update it no problem. My team got the css done in like a day(I don't remeber exactly). I had forgot about sending my client the link, so on Dec 16th I made sure that it was sent on Outlook.</p>
        <h2>How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?</h2>
        <p>I don't like gethub because I don't understand it. I am very proud of how the website turned out for our client. He gave us great colors, pictures, and font styles that all blended well together and the team made the css look very professional with its simple and sleek design.</p>

        <h2>How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues?</h2>
        <h3>Spencer Ayim</h3>
        <p>After I contacted Spencer Ayim on outlook. He emailed me the link to our github project with a discription of what he had already done, but he didn't give me any instrutions. As I was fillout this report I revisted our emails and I think he got me mixed up with his client.</p>
        <h3>Daniel Parker</h3>
        <p>I sent Daniel Parker my github contact through out look, but he never emailed me back. I decided to let him have the responsibilty of reaching out to me since I was preocupied by trying to figure out how to get github up and running and how to cordinate with my own junior devs.</p>
        <h2>Did you know what was expected of you for each site?</h2>
        <p>No I never receved any Instrutions from either of my Lead Devs.</p>
        <h2>Were you able to contribute to your sites?</h2>
        <p>No. By the time I passed on my work to my junior devs and took a look at my other team projects. I found that the pages were completely done.</p>
        <h2>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?</h2>
        <p>I am completely new to github and that slowed me down in the begining. Once github was set up and Professor Alvey showed me how to clone repositories on my desktop. I expeiceced minimal glitchs when pushing updates to my repositories</p>

        <h1>General Report</h1>
        <h2>What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?</h2>
        <p>Compunication through outlook. My devs didn't give me respoisibilities and completed the sites without me. I didn't reach out to them very much because I was trying to figure out how to set up my github page and convert the site plan for my client into html. I also had to regather contact information from all for of my teams because the first few times I had got emails that they don't use and I hadn't gotten their githubs. I also had to wait several days for Daniel to find time to resend me a github invitaion to join his project.</p>
        <h2>What did you enjoy most about this project?</h2>
        <p>Seeing the amasing job my junior devs did on styling our website for Brigham Peterson.</p>
        <h2>What would you do differently if you could do the project again?</h2>
        <p>I would be more carefull about getting everyones contacts on the first day, emailing them all to verify that they can contact me, and making sure that we all had gained access to the repositoreies. It would also be nice to already know how to use github.</p>
        <h2>Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.</h2>
        <p>I feel more confident in my ability to contribute to a project had have it benifit the project and not clash with other's work.</p>
        <p>I got to experience that first hand with the project that I was over, when I sent my completed html to my junior devs and got back complete and clean css.</p>
        <p>I don't feel confident in joining future projects however because this level of asumptions and lack of communication, I have found to be very common in our society. Even at the business I work for.</p>
        <p>When you join projects or give you respoisibility, they talk as if you already know the details of the project as well as they do. It is very overwhelming, escpial becasue everyone is busy with their work so you are left with no supervision or anyone teaching how to do things. Speaking more from past experience and observation, since I didn't receve instrutions from my Lead Devs.</p>
